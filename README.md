# Introduction
Song Explorer is an intuitive Shiny app that enables users to search for artists, visualize their song release patterns over time through interactive histograms, and examine detailed discographies in a sortable table with the option to download the data. Here is the URL link to my Shiny app:

# Features
- **Thematic Image**: A visually engaging image is placed below the app title, setting the theme and enriching the user interface with a creative touch.
- **Artist Search Functionality**: Users can enter an artist's name in the provided input field to filter the dataset and generate a custom visualization of song releases across different years for the selected artist.
- **Interactive Histogram**: The app showcases an interactive histogram that dynamically represents the number of songs released per year. It offers an instant graphical representation of an artist's creative timeline.
- **Sortable Data Table**: Beneath the histogram lies a detailed and interactive table that lists song titles, artists, release years, cities, and albums. The table can be sorted and filtered by each column, enabling users to organize the data to fit their inquiries.
- **Data Download**: A download button, located below the data table, allows users to download the data they are currently viewing as a CSV file, which can be useful for further analysis outside of the application.
